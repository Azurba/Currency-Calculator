# Currency Calculator.

This app was created by Joao Pimenta Giudice. It was adapted by a Flutter Online
Course developed by Daniel Ciolfi. The creation of this app was mainly to prepare myself to my
internship at Diletta Aplicativos during summer 2019.

The app uses an API of the website HG Brasil, in which offers a variety of free API json data 
for developers to use. This app specificaly is using the HG Finance to get the most recent
currency values of Brazilian Real, US Dolar and Euro.

App created: summer 2019
Latest update: August 2021
